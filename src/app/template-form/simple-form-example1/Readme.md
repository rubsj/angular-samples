The specification for this example is the following:
- name - is required and unique among all registered users
- birthYear - should be a valid number and the user must have at least 18 and less than 85 years
- country - is mandatory, and just to make things a bit complicated, we need a validation that if the country is India, then the city must be Delhi (let’s say that our service is offered only in Delhi)
- phoneNumber – each phone number must follow a specified pattern, there must be at least one phone number, and the user is allowed to add a new or remove an existing telephone number.
- The “Register” button is enabled only if all inputs are valid and, once clicked, it submits the form.
- The “Print to Console” just prints the value of all inputs to console when clicked.
The ultimate goal is to fully implement the specification defined.
